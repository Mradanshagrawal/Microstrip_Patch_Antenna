A microstrip patch antenna is a type of antenna that is widely used in modern communication systems due to its low profile, lightweight, and low cost. This produces a radiation pattern with a low profile and a predominant broadside radiation pattern, making it appropriate for a variety of applications.

# Designing
To achieve the intended radiation pattern and frequency response, the patch is typically built in a specific form, such as rectangular, circular, or triangular. The resonance frequency of the antenna, which is typically in the range of a few GHz to tens of GHz, is determined by the size and form of the patch. As a ground plane, the grounded substrate beneath the patch serves as a conduit for current flowing on the patch to return to the substrate.

# Applications
Microstrip patch antennas are utilised in radar systems because they may provide a directional radiation pattern with a high gain. Additionally, they are utilised in weather radar systems, collision avoidance systems, and radar altimeters.

Earth observation and environmental remote sensing are two remote sensing applications that use microstrip patch antennas. Additionally, they are employed in geolocation and remote sensing via satellite systems.

Automobile Applications: Microstrip patch antennas are employed in telematics, GPS, and collision avoidance systems, among other car applications.
